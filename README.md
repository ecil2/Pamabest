# Introduction

Hey guys, and welcome to GitHub, where Web Developers and Programmers come together and organise their shit (and make sure they know what code has been committed to their projects, in case of malware).

Basic things to know:
Download and install the GitHub desktop program
How to Commit changes
How to create Issues

GitHub has a starter tutorial which you guys could splash over, and I recommend you do, skipping through to the points I mentioned earlier if you are short on time.
